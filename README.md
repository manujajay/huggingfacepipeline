# huggingfacepipeline
Looking at the pipeline from Hugging Face for Pretrained Neural Networks - using the pipeline for sentiment analysis.

Pipeline() is the easiest way to use a pre-trained model for a given task.

We will just be downloading and caching a default pre-trained model and tokenizer: 'sentiment-analysis'

We will then be using that classifier on a target text to get the sentiment score and positive/negative signals and scores
